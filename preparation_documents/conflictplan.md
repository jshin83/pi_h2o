# Conflict Plan

*What will your group do when it encounters conflict?*

1. identify that conflict has arisen
2. laptops down for everyone
3. identify the feelings behind the conflict
4. come to a solution that makes everyone happy

*How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?*

- During a daily stand-up in our group, looks at blocks and check-in about individual progress
- Speak to them privately and find if there are blockers that are private / sensitive issues
- Offer to pair program
- After lunch check-in to discuss blockers and goals for the afternoon

*What is your process to resolve conflicts?*

- If there is no majority vote, the group will go to the TA or teacher for discussion.
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?
- If we can't complete step 4 within 30 minutes, we will bring issue to a TA or Prof.
