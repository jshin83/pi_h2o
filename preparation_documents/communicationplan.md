# Communication Plan

*Workflow*

+ All team members should work ONLY branches and NEVER on master.
+ Branch names should include feature.
+ Commit messages should be descriptive.
+ Include descriptive comments if necessary.
+ Code: spacing and comments, standardize this for team
+ Work 9am - 5pm weekdays.  Let team know if any personal issues come in the way of working together or if WFH required.
+ Work after hours will only push branch and create pull request. Discuss the next day before merge. Will try to work in pairs and review PR for others promptly.
+ Merges will not be made by requestor.

*How will you communicate during the week daytime?*

+ Have a stand up in the morning and afternoon around 1500-ish.

*How will you communicate after hours?*
+ We will use our Chime private group.

*What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?*

+ Ensure everyone has room to talk. 
+ Ask everyone by name what they think.

*How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?*
+ All ideas will have space to be heard. 
+ Avoid non-constructive criticisms of ideas. 
+ Adding the question: "how are you feeling?" during twice daily check-ins.
